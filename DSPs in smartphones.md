In modern smartphones, there are typically **multiple DSPs** (Digital Signal Processors) working in tandem to handle various tasks efficiently. These DSPs are highly specialized and are integrated into different parts of the smartphone's **System-on-Chip (SoC)** architecture. Here's a breakdown of how many DSPs a modern smartphone might have, along with their roles:

### 1. **Primary DSP (e.g., Qualcomm Hexagon DSP)**
Most smartphone SoCs from major manufacturers (Qualcomm, MediaTek, Samsung, etc.) feature a **primary DSP** integrated into the chipset. For example, Qualcomm Snapdragon SoCs include the **Hexagon DSP**. The role of this main DSP is broad and covers:

- **Audio and voice processing**: Real-time noise suppression, echo cancellation, and voice recognition (for voice assistants like Google Assistant, Siri, etc.).
- **AI and machine learning**: In recent SoCs, the DSP often handles AI-related tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and facial recognition.
- **Sensor fusion**: The DSP manages data from various sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, proximity sensor) to process real-time information about device orientation and motion.

#### Example:
- **Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and 8 Gen 1** use the **Hexagon 780 DSP**, which combines scalar, vector, and tensor accelerators into a unified architecture. This allows the DSP to handle AI processing, voice control, and computational photography.

### 2. **Modem DSP (Dedicated DSP for Cellular Modems)**
Modern smartphones need powerful processing for handling complex 4G/5G cellular communications, and DSPs are essential for modulating and demodulating signals, error correction, and improving data throughput. The **modem DSP** is dedicated to:

- **Signal processing for cellular communications**: Managing 4G LTE, 5G NR (New Radio), and even Wi-Fi and Bluetooth standards.
- **Massive MIMO**: In 5G, DSPs are critical for handling multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems, beamforming, and ensuring low-latency connections.
  
#### Example:
- Qualcomm’s **Snapdragon X60 modem-RF system** (used in Snapdragon 888) has DSPs for 5G communication, handling massive data streams and performing signal processing for higher data rates and efficient spectrum utilization.

### 3. **Image Signal Processor (ISP) with DSP-like Features**
Many SoCs include a dedicated **Image Signal Processor (ISP)** for handling computational photography tasks. While an ISP isn't technically a DSP, it shares many DSP-like features and is optimized for real-time image and video processing:

- **Real-time image enhancement**: Noise reduction, HDR, depth processing, and multi-frame image blending.
- **Video processing**: High-resolution video recording (e.g., 8K), image stabilization, and frame rate control.

#### Example:
- Qualcomm’s **Spectra 580 ISP** in Snapdragon 888 integrates image processing tasks, and parts of the processing pipeline are handled by DSP-like units to process real-time data from camera sensors efficiently.

### 4. **Audio DSP (Hi-Fi Audio and Low-Power Always-On DSPs)**
Many smartphones include additional **audio-specific DSPs** for handling audio playback, speech processing, and the "always-on" tasks that enable voice assistants like Google Assistant or Siri to listen for commands even when the phone is idle.

- **Hi-Fi audio**: High-quality audio processing (e.g., Dolby Atmos, DTS:X) is often offloaded to a dedicated audio DSP.
- **Voice control**: DSPs handle the low-power, always-on functions, enabling voice assistants to process speech commands without draining the battery.

#### Example:
- Smartphones with **Qualcomm Aqstic audio DSP** handle high-resolution audio playback and microphone processing for voice assistants.

### 5. **Sensor Hub DSP (Low-Power, Always-On Tasks)**
Some smartphones feature a **dedicated low-power sensor hub DSP**, often part of the SoC or an independent chip. This DSP is responsible for:

- **Always-on sensing**: Managing tasks like motion tracking, ambient light detection, and other sensor-based activities when the phone is in a low-power state or idle.
- **Gesture recognition and health monitoring**: It might also handle gesture inputs or fitness data tracking (e.g., steps, sleep analysis) in the background.

#### Example:
- Qualcomm’s **Hexagon DSP** or **Google’s Sensor Core** is used for managing low-power background sensor processing.

### 6. **Dedicated AI Accelerators with DSP Components**
Some modern smartphones also integrate **dedicated AI accelerators** that function similarly to DSPs but are optimized for machine learning tasks. These AI accelerators are often involved in computational photography, real-time translation, and AR/VR processing.

- **Neural Processing Units (NPUs)** or **Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)** are sometimes a separate module on the SoC that helps accelerate AI-driven workloads alongside the main DSP.

#### Example:
- **Apple’s Neural Engine** in the A14/A15 Bionic chips or Qualcomm's **AI Engine** includes DSP cores to enhance the processing of machine learning tasks, including real-time language translation or computational photography.

### Summary: How Many DSPs in a Smartphone?
While it varies by design and manufacturer, here’s a typical breakdown for high-end smartphones:

1. **Primary DSP** (like Qualcomm Hexagon): 1
2. **Modem DSP** (for cellular modems like 5G): 1
3. **ISP with DSP-like capabilities** (for image processing): 1 (may contain multiple sub-processing units)
4. **Audio DSP** (for high-quality audio and voice commands): 1 or more
5. **Sensor Hub DSP** (low-power tasks and always-on sensors): 1

**Total DSPs: 3 to 5 dedicated DSPs**, depending on the specific SoC and additional components.

However, this count can go higher depending on how many specialized chips the manufacturer includes, especially in advanced **AI-focused** or **camera-heavy** smartphones. For instance, some flagships might include more custom-designed processors for advanced tasks like **machine learning** or **audio processing**, contributing to multiple DSP-like modules across the system.

Modern smartphones typically feature multiple DSPs (Digital Signal Processors) to enhance both audio and video functionalities, especially for handling tasks that demand efficient, real-time processing while minimizing power consumption.

For **audio DSP**, Qualcomm's **Aqstic audio codecs** are a popular solution found in Snapdragon SoCs. The Aqstic codec, like the **WCD937x series**, delivers high-quality audio, rivaling some standalone DACs, and supports advanced audio experiences such as hi-fi playback and noise suppression. These DSPs handle tasks like voice processing, echo cancellation, and immersive soundscapes for both gaming and media consumption (see [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/internet-of-things/consumer/audio/mobile-audio), [Notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-unveils-its-latest-series-of-Aqstic-audio-codecs.424300.0.html))

On the video side, Qualcomm's **Hexagon DSP** plays a significant role. This architecture, found in chipsets like the Snapdragon 8 series, offloads tasks such as video encoding, decoding, and computational photography. For example, in low-light photography, the **Hexagon DSP** works alongside the **Spectra ISP** (Image Signal Processor) to enhance image and video quality. Additionally, it is crucial for energy-efficient processing of tasks like computer vision, augmented reality (AR), and video streaming (see [DSP Concepts](https://audioinnovation.dspconcepts.com/demos/qc-snapdragon)).

These DSPs provide essential capabilities, improving audio clarity, visual detail, and battery performance while managing complex real-time operations.
