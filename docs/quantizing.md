**Quantizing** is the process of mapping a continuous range of values into a finite set of discrete levels. Typically these values are read by [[sampling]] a [[signal]]. In [[digital]] systems, this is typically applied to convert an [[analog]] [[signal]] into [[digital]] form by rounding the [[signal]]'s amplitude to the nearest level in a predefined range. Quantizing is a key step in processes like [[pulse-code modulation]] to ensure the [[data]] can be stored and processed digitally.
