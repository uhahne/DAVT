**What is Digital Signal Processing?**

Digital signal processing (DSP) is the analysis, modification, and transformation of discrete-time [[signal]]s using computational algorithms and mathematical techniques. It involves converting [[analog]] signals into [[digital]] [[signal]]s using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), processing these digital signals using various algorithms and techniques, and then re-converting them back to analog signals if necessary.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Signal representation**: DSP deals with discrete-time signals that are represented as a sequence of numbers.
2. **Filtering**: Removing unwanted frequencies or noise from the signal.
3. **Transformation**: Converting the signal into another domain, such as frequency or time-frequency domains.
4. **Amplification and compression**: Enhancing or reducing the amplitude of the signal.

**Applications:**
1. **Audio processing**: Music and voice compression, noise reduction, echo cancellation, etc.
2. **Image processing**: Image filtering, denoising, compression, etc.
3. **Communication systems**: Channel equalization, modulation analysis, etc.

**Useful Resources:**
1. **DSP tutorial** by MathWorks (Matlab): A comprehensive introduction to DSP concepts, algorithms, and techniques.
* [https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/digital-signal-processing.html](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/digital-signal-processing.html)

3. **Wikipedia article**: A detailed overview of DSP concepts, history, and applications.
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing)

These resources should provide a good starting point for understanding the basics of digital signal processing.
